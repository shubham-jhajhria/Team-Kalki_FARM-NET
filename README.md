A base model for weeds (Unwanted plants) detection in crops which can be further integrated with Robots and Drones for picking out weeds and for density based mapping of weeds.
The model is sensitive towards 26+ types of weeds over 4 types of crop fields.
Developed and presented during a Hackathon organised by MNIT Jaipur in collaboration with IEEE-CIS.
